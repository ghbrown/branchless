A comparison of the relative speedup achieved by [branchless programming](https://dev.to/jobinrjohnson/branchless-programming-does-it-really-matter-20j4) techniques in a variety of languages.


### Speedups by langauge
For each language and test pair, the relative speedup is given as `t_branchless/t_branched`, where `t_branchless` is the CPU time taken by the branchless implementation, and `t_branched` is the time taken by the branched implementation.

<you should autogenerate a plot on run>
<bar plot with up and down bars around ratio=1>
<generate plot, capture as file, then link to file name in README>

### The tests
`num_thresh`: given a random array of numbers, how many of them are above some threshold
